Thesis Work
================
Noah Edwards-Thro

This is for the purpose of completing an Honors Thesis in Mathematical
Business at Wake Forest University. My thesis was completed on NBA
Player Clustering Using Gaussian Mixture Modeling, specifically using
the mclust package in R. It was inspired by a paper presented at the
2020 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference by Samuel Kalman and Jonathan
Bosch called “NBA Lineup Analysis on Clustered Player Tendencies: A new
approach to the positions of basketball & modeling lineup efficiency of
soft lineup aggregates”. My work expands on their paper by analyzing how
their clustering model performs on the most recent three years of NBA
data and by investigating potential ways to achieve variable reduction
with similar results.

The data can be found in the Data folder, further broken down into Raw
Data, Cleaned Data, and Predictions Folders.

The code can be found in the code folder, further broken down into Data
Scraper, Data Cleaner, Models, Predictions, Z Value Analysis, and
Figures R files.

There is an RDAs folder that is used to either bring in some figures or
to bring in to the Final Report RMD some of the intermediate data that
is not raw but also not fully cleaned.

The final paper can be found in the Final Paper pdf.
