    abstract = {Everyone agrees that reproducibility and replicability
      are fundamental characteristics of scientific studies. These
      topics are attracting increasing attention, scrutiny, and debate
      both in the popular press and the scientific literature. But
      there are no formal statistical definitions for these concepts,
      which leads to confusion since the same words are used for
      different concepts by different people in different fields. We
      provide formal and informal definitions of scientific studies,
      reproducibility, and replicability that can be used to clarify
      discussions around these concepts in the scientific and popular
      press.},
